# GlimBoi
A chatbot for Glimesh.tv

This chatbot has two modes.

## GUI
This is the normal mode for the bot. This is a user interface which you use to link your bot to chat and manage commands, quotes, and users.
You can connect the bot to chat using the GUI but it is not the recomended option.

## Server Mode
This mode was created with resources in mind. The GUI is great for managing the bot but it uses Electron. Electron is built on Chromimum which uses a lot of resources. To combat this I created server mode. This is a non UI mode. The bot will be running in the background without any GPU overhead. It uses minimil resources and has the same functionnality of the GUI.

## What do I use?
Create your bot in the GUI mode. When you are ready to stream switch to server mode. All your changes will be saved and this will save you a ton of resources!

## Updates
Windows can recieve updates. Other platforms must manually update.

## Platforms
This works on Windows, Linux (deb), and Mac but you must use wine or build the package yourslef. It is very easy, you must do some things in terminal to accomplish this.
