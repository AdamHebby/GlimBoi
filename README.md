## Setup
Download the bot from the releases page.
Run the installer for your platform. Windows users can use the .exe file. Mac and Linux users can use Wine or build the app manually.

## Login
GlimBoi uses oAuth to connect to the glimesh service. You must create a dev app to use GlimBoi. This allows for a *custom bot name.*
Go to https://glimesh.tv/users/settings/applications and make an application on the account with the desired name. Many users create a new account with the desired (bot) name. This is where the app needs to be created. 


## Usage
GlimBoi has a basic GUI for interacting with the bot. You can create commands and manage users. You can also create a currency system for your viewers to spend points with. They can be used for games and trading. Your moderators can control basic functions of the bot. 


## Updates
Windows can recieve automatic updates. Other platforms must manually update. You can download any version of the bot from the releases page. If the platform you want is not supported you can manually build the bot from the source code. Your platform must support Electron. 
This is a work in progress.


*This bot is in alpha. There will be bugs, crashes, and other errors. Report all issues on our issue page or to [Glimesh.tv/Mytho](https://glimesh.tv/Mytho)
