## Contributing to the Bot
 
Anyone can contribute to the bot. Use the following instructions to begin contributing.

1. **Fork the repo.**  Start by creating a fork.  Download the fork to your PC. 
2. **Create a new branch.** Create a new branch titled the name of the feature you are adding. You can have multiple features per branch but you must document any changes.
3. **Install npm packages.** In your terminal run `npm install` . Then run `npm install electron -g` . Finally, run `npm start`.
4. **Make your changes.** Add the new feature or bug fix. If you need help or ideas you can make an issue on our github page.
5. **Make a pull request.**  When you have made all the changes submit a pull request. Merge your new feature branch into the dev branch on the main repo. We may ask for changes or we will merge it to begin testing. If everything works as expected it will be merged to the main branch.

Thank you for contributing!
