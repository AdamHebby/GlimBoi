# GlimBoi Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help out with the bot. Here are a few things that you will need to get the bot to run.

 - [NodeJS]([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
 - Any IDE ex. [VScode]([Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
 - General JS/CSS/HTML knowledge. Having experience with Electron would be helpful.

Create an empty folder and clone the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/aMytho/GlimBoi.git`

Now you need to install the dependencies. In the repo run

`npm install`

## Good Practices

w r i t e c l e a n c o d e
Comment any new code added. We need this to be human readable.
Try to avoid adding new libraries.
Submit an issue about what you are fixing/adding before starting dev.

## Merge

When you are completed submit a PR about your changes. Describe whatever you changed. 

Thank you for contributing!
